Hi,

I just realized going through my submission that as at the time of uploading
my file, For the Question 12, the r2 squared value in my submission was that of
X_train instead of y_train which I used in answering the Quiz.

I apologize for any inconvenience caused by my mistake.

Thanks,
Arogundade Abdulmajeed
